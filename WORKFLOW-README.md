# Seamless Update Workflow for WoloApp

> Status legend: ‚úÖ Completed | üöß In progress | ‚ùå Not started | üü° Needs review

This document explains how to make updates to the WoloApp project that will automatically appear on wolosenegal.com without any manual intervention.

## How It Works

1. **File Changes**: When you modify any files in the project
2. **Auto-Sync**: The system automatically detects changes every 30 seconds
3. **Git Operations**: Changes are automatically committed and pushed to GitHub
4. **GitHub Actions**: Deployment workflow triggers on every push to main branch
5. **Vercel Deployment**: Code is automatically built and deployed to Vercel
6. **Live Site**: Changes appear on wolosenegal.com within minutes

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Start Auto-Sync (One-time setup)
- Double-click the `start-auto-sync.bat` file in your project folder
- Keep the PowerShell window running (you can minimize it)

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Edit any files in the project as needed
- Save your changes normally

### 3. Automatic Sync to GitHub
- The auto-sync system detects your changes within 30 seconds
- Files are automatically added, committed, and pushed to GitHub

### 4. Automatic Deployment to wolosenegal.com
- GitHub Actions workflow automatically triggers
- Vercel builds and deploys the updated code
- Changes appear on wolosenegal.com typically within 2-5 minutes

## No Manual Steps Required

Once you start the auto-sync system, you don't need to:
- Run any Git commands
- Manually commit or push changes
- Trigger deployments
- Monitor the deployment process

Everything happens automatically in the background.

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see changes on wolosenegal.com after 10 minutes:
1. Check that the auto-sync PowerShell window is still running
2. Verify there are no error messages in the auto-sync window
3. Confirm the changes were saved in your files

## Example Workflow

1. Open `src/app/page.tsx` in your editor
2. Change some text (e.g., modify line 100: "Wolo Senegal is being engineered..." to "Wolo Senegal - Birthday Fundraising Platform")
3. Save the file
4. Wait 30 seconds for auto-sync, then 2-5 minutes for deployment
5. Visit wolosenegal.com to see your changes live

The entire process is completely automated and requires no manual intervention after the initial setup.
