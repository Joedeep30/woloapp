# WOLO Microservices Architecture

üöÄ **Modern, scalable microservices architecture for the WOLO birthday crowdfunding platform**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This microservices architecture transforms your WOLO application into a distributed, scalable system with the following benefits:

- **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently based on demand

node start-all.js
```

#### Option 2: Start Services Individually
```bash
# Terminal 1: API Gateway
cd api-gateway && node server.js

# Terminal 2: User Management
cd user-management && node server.js

# Add more terminals for other services...
```

#### Option 3: Docker Compose (Production)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## üåê API Endpoints

All API requests go through the API Gateway at `http://localhost:3000`:

### üë§ User Management
```bash
POST /api/users/auth/register        # User registration
POST /api/users/auth/login          # User login
POST /api/users/auth/social-login   # Social login
POST /api/users/auth/refresh-token  # Refresh JWT token
GET  /api/users/auth/me             # Get current user
GET  /api/users/profile             # Get user profile

## üìä Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Check Endpoints
```bash
GET /health                         # API Gateway health
GET /api/users/health              # User service health
GET /api/pots/health               # Pot service health
# ... and so on for each service
```

### Service Discovery
```bash
GET /services                      # List all registered services
```

### Monitoring Features

- **Process Management**: Automatic restart on crashes
- **Request Logging**: Detailed request/response logging
- **Error Tracking**: Structured error handling and reporting
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and throughput tracking

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

The architecture includes Docker support for easy deployment:

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild specific service
docker-compose up -d --build api-gateway
```

## üìà Scalability Patterns

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more instances of services based on load
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across service instances
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Service Mesh**: Advanced traffic management with Istio/Linkerd
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching with Redis

## üîß Development Workflow

1. **Service Independence**: Develop and test each service independently
2. **API Contracts**: Define clear interfaces between services
3. **Database Per Service**: Each service has its own data domain
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate via events when possible
5. **Versioning Strategy**: API versioning for backward compatibility

## üìù Next Steps

To complete the microservices implementation:

1. **Create Missing Services**: Build the remaining 5 microservices following the same patterns
2. **Database Schema**: Ensure your Supabase tables support the microservices architecture
3. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up automated deployment
5. **Observability**: Add metrics, tracing, and alerting
6. **Documentation**: API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Each service should be self-contained and independently deployable
2. Follow the established patterns for configuration and error handling
3. Add proper logging and monitoring for new services
4. Include health checks and graceful shutdown handling
5. Update this README when adding new services

## üìû Support

For questions about the microservices architecture:
- Check service health: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- View service discovery: `http://localhost:3000/services`
- Monitor logs in the terminal or Docker logs
- Review individual service documentation
